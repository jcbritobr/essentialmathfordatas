    "# Exponents\n",
    "Exponents multiply a number by itself a specified number of times. When you raise 2 to the third power (expressed as $2^3$ using 3 as superscript), that is multiplying three 2s together.\n",
    "$$2^3=2*2*2*2$$\n",
    "The _base_ is the variable or value we are exponentiating, and exponent is the number of times we multiply the base value. For expression $2^3$, 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent.\n",
    "Exponents have few interesting properties. Say we multiplied $x^2$ and $y^3$ together. If we expand the exponents thats is what we got:\n",
    "$$x^2x^3=(x*x)*(x*x*x)=x^{2+3}=x‚Åµ5$$\n",
    "So, when we multiply exponents together with the same base, we simply add the exponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lets explore the division**. What happens when we divide $x^2$ by $x^5$? We perform a subtraction $x^{2 -5}$:\n",

    "They are an alternative way represent roots, such as the square root. As a brief refresher, a $\\sqrt{4}$ asks \"what number multiplied by itself will give me 4?\", which of course is 2. Note that $4^{1/2}$ is the same as $\\sqrt{4}$.\n",
    "Cube roots are similar to square roots, but they seek a number multiplied by itself three times to give a result. A cubed root of 8 is expressed as $\\sqrt[3]{8}$. One last property is the exponent of an exponent will multiply the exponents together. This is known as the _power rule_. So $\\big(8^3\\big)^2$ whould simplify to $8^6$."
